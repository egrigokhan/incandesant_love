# Arduino Morse Code Decoder Using LDR

This is a simple Morse code decoder which uses Arduino in order to read light signals as dashes and dots which are then converted into characters from the English alphabet.

# Libraries

- Wire.h
- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h

While the Wire library comes pre-installed with the Wire library, the LiquidCrystal_I2C library needs to be manually installed from https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/LCD.
